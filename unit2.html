    <h4>1.5  Describing copyright and
            other constraints affecting
            websites </h4>
    <p>Copyright is a legal right, giving the owner control over their work and how it is used. It gives creators protection against the use of their work without permission.<br> Owners of copyright can use, sell or licence a work to a third party. Copyright normally protects the work created by, or 'originated' with, the author. <br>There must have been some skill, labour or judgment in the creation of the work and it must be original.<br>   
            The most fundamental of those constraints is that you can’t fix where objects will appear on a viewer’s screen.<br>The point is, you can define where things appear on screen, but you can do so only relative to the viewer’s viewing environment.
            </p>

            appropriate filetypes for

     <h4>1.6  Describing access issues
            that need taking into account</h4>      
       
      <p>

           <p>
             The Internet isn't always "one size fits all." Every day, inaccessible web design prevents billions of people in the disabled community from an easy online experience.<br>

            For those with visual impairments, learning difficulties, hearing loss and more, there are dozens of unique challenges waiting behind every URL.
            There are however methods that can be implemented to your website to make it more disability friendly:</p>

            <h4 class="h">USE ALT TAGS.</h4>
           <p> When you hover your mouse over an image on a website, the little words that pop up are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads the text on a website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is.</p>

            <h4 class="h">PUT PERIODS IN ABBREVIATIONS.</h4>

            <p>If you're abbreviating something in HTML, put periods in between each letter. For example, if you're referencing the Central Intelligence Agency, write it out as C.I.A., rather than CIA. A screen reader won't recognize the abbreviation without periods, and will instead read it out phonetically as a word (C-I-A will be read as "cia").</p>

           <h4 class="h"> UTILIZE COLOR CONTROL.</h4>

           <p>Practicing smart color choices is useful for a website with any kind of audience. Avoid pairing garish colors, and be wary of using yellow, blue and green close to one another (this is especially difficult for colorblind users). Black text on a white background is the best general practice, because it's readable for most audiences.</p>

           <h4 class="h"> KEEP YOUR COPY SIMPLE.</h4>

           <p>This tip is helpful for any audience, but is imperative for elderly audiences or those with learning disabilities. If you're putting a lot of text onto your website, break it into smaller paragraphs. Use simple, straightforward language in the active voice.
            Naturally, this might not work for all sites, depending on the content, but you can apply it to various pages (such as an "About" or "History" section).</p>
             
            <h4 class="h"> GET CLICKABLE.</h4>

            <p>For users with mobility problems, it can be difficult to click on small items within a tiny clickable range. It’s like trying to nail a bullseye every single time you play a game of darts. Give the clickable item a wider range so the user can click on it within the item's general area.</p>
