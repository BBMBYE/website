    <h4>1.5  Describing copyright and
            other constraints affecting
            websites </h4>
    <p>Copyright is a legal right, giving the owner control over their work and how it is used. It gives creators protection against the use of their work without permission.<br> Owners of copyright can use, sell or licence a work to a third party. Copyright normally protects the work created by, or 'originated' with, the author. <br>There must have been some skill, labour or judgment in the creation of the work and it must be original.<br>   
            The most fundamental of those constraints is that you can’t fix where objects will appear on a viewer’s screen.<br>The point is, you can define where things appear on screen, but you can do so only relative to the viewer’s viewing environment.
            </p>
     <h4>1.7 Describe which are the
            appropriate filetypes for
            websites</h4>
     <p>File Types for websites:
   <ul>
           <li> .AVI </li>
           <li>.CSS </li>
           <li>.DOC </li> 
           <li>.EXE</li>  
           <li>.GIF </li>
           <li> .HTML/ .HTM </li> 
           <li>.JPG/ .JPEG </li>
           <li> .MID/ .MIDI </li> 
           <li>.MP3 </li>
           <li> .MPG/ .MPEG </li> 
           <li> .MOV/ .QT </li>
           <li> .PDF </li>
           <li> .PNG </li>

    <h4>3.1  Review the benefits and
            drawbacks of IT tools and
            systems used in terms of
            productivity and efficiency –
            could you have been more
            efficient when making your
            website? How? Could you have
            done it in teams? </h4>
          <p> Benefits of using VS Code:</p>

        <ol> 
          <li> For programming language:- IntelliSense is a general term used for a variety of code editing features: code completion, parameter info, quick info, “code completion”, “content assist”, and “code hinting.”</li>
           
          <li>Visual studio supports inbuilt Integrated terminal, initially starting at the root of your opened project. This feature makes its very convenient as we don’t have to switch windows or alter the state of an existing terminal to perform a quick command line task</li>
           
          <li>Visual Studio Code has Git integration built-in, which makes it really easy to instantly see the changes you’re making in your project.</li>
        </ol>
           
          <p> Drawbacks of using VS Code:</p>
           <ol>
          <li> Little support for other languages, including popular ones like Python. </li>
           
          <li> It's not an IDE and isn't meant to be one, so if you are used to a feature rich product from JetBrains, you will be disappointed. </li>
       
        </ol>
        <h4>3.2 Describe ways to improve
                productivity and efficiency</h4>
                <p>
                
                    <ul>

                       <li>Plan your work and work your plan. Set aside 10 to 15 planning minutes at the start of each day or at the end of your day to create a to-do list for your upcoming activities and you will know what your important tasks are before you start the day.</li> <br>
                        
                       <li>Write down the important tasks and set them in order of priority.</li> <br>
                        
                        <li>Many long-term projects are never started because the whole endeavor seems so daunting. We take on the entire project all at once and overwhelm ourselves. Take small steps that you know you can accomplish. The more realistic your expectations the better.</li> <br>
                        
                         <li>When your energy level drops or you are becoming too reactive to others, take time to rejuvenate yourself by taking a break.</li> <br>
                        
                         <li>Review your to-do list to examine what you accomplished, what you could have done more efficiently, and what you need to get done tomorrow.</li> 
                    </ul>
                        </p>
