        <h4>2.1  Review the ongoing use of
                IT tools and change approach
                as needed – in making your
                own website, are you happy
                with the tools you used?</h4> 
        <p>When using visual studio code to create my website, there was little difficulty, since I already have a general idea about where things are, since we last used it for javascript.<br> However, in a perfect scenario, I would have preferred to use a windows PC than a Mac. I found the Mac fidgety, and wouldn’t usually respond to what I want it to do, which was frustrating.
        Furthermore, the use of  trello board was beneficial, and helped me keep track of my work, showing me a list of things that need to be done, the one’s I am doing, and those that have been completed.<br> This organises my work, and makes the huge task into smaller tasks, making the daunting task of creating a website look simplified. 
                </p>

      <h4>2.2  Describe whether the IT tools
            selected were appropriate</h4> 
      <p>The IT tools I used to create this website, where very handy, even though it was the first time I was using software such as trello, visual studio code, and codepen.<br> It won't be the last time, and will probably lean on using these softwares during my university years and beyond.
        </p>

     <h4>2.3 Assess the strengths and
            weaknesses of your final
            project. </h4>
     <p>I’m satisfied with the website I created. However, given a longer time frame, and a competent skill on HTML, I believe I would have done a better job.<br> The only reason why I'm disatisfied with the website, is because we had to create a blog, and I believe with blogs you don’t necessarily have the freedom of creation and style, because you’re more focused on the content.
        </p> 

     <h4>2.4  Describe further
            improvements you can
            make to your project </h4>    
     <p>Further improvements I would make to the project is use a better IDE than visual studio code, because technically it’s not really one. So using something like eclipse or NetBeans, would have been a better option.

        </p>
     <h4>2.5  Review outcomes to
            make sure they match
            requirements and are fit for
            purpose</h4>     
     <p>To rate my website out of a 10, with how satisfied I am with it, I’ll give it a 4, because I had so many ideas, which I just wasn't able to implement. In some cases, due to lack of skill and knowledge, in others, due to the lack of sufficient time.
        </p>

            <h4>3.1  Review the benefits and
                    drawbacks of IT tools and
                    systems used in terms of
                    productivity and efficiency –
                    could you have been more
                    efficient when making your
                    website? How? Could you have
                    done it in teams? </h4>
                  <p> Benefits of using VS Code:</p>
        
                <ol> 
                  <li> For programming language:- IntelliSense is a general term used for a variety of code editing features: code completion, parameter info, quick info, “code completion”, “content assist”, and “code hinting.”</li>
                   
                  <li>Visual studio supports inbuilt Integrated terminal, initially starting at the root of your opened project. This feature makes its very convenient as we don’t have to switch windows or alter the state of an existing terminal to perform a quick command line task</li>
                   
                  <li>Visual Studio Code has Git integration built-in, which makes it really easy to instantly see the changes you’re making in your project.</li>
                </ol>
                   
                  <p> Drawbacks of using VS Code:</p>
                   <ol>
                  <li> Little support for other languages, including popular ones like Python. </li>
                   
                  <li> It's not an IDE and isn't meant to be one, so if you are used to a feature rich product from JetBrains, you will be disappointed. </li>
               
                </ol>
                <h4>3.2 Describe ways to improve
                    productivity and efficiency</h4>
                    <p>
                        
                   <ul>
        
                  <li>Plan your work and work your plan. Set aside 10 to 15 planning minutes at the start of each day or at the end of your day to create a to-do list for your upcoming activities and you will know what your important tasks are before you start the day.</li> <br>
                                
                  <li>Write down the important tasks and set them in order of priority.</li> <br>
                    
                    <li>Many long-term projects are never started because the whole endeavor seems so daunting. We take on the entire project all at once and overwhelm ourselves. Take small steps that you know you can accomplish. The more realistic your expectations the better.</li> <br>
                                
                     <li>When your energy level drops or you are becoming too reactive to others, take time to rejuvenate yourself by taking a break.</li> <br>
                                
                     <li>Review your to-do list to examine what you accomplished, what you could have done more efficiently, and what you need to get done tomorrow.</li> 
                        </ul>

                                       differently next time? Team work?
                                    Use of Slack? </h4>
                                <p> Working in a team, would have been a better way. There would be a broader range of ideas, and like John Heywood’s said in 1546, two heads are better than one. Assigning tasks to each member, and using software like slack and trello to monitor progress, would have made working in a team easier.

                                 <h4 class="h">Black box testing:</h4>
                                 <p>Black box testing is designed to test the functionality of software. For example:
                                     <ul>
                                       <li> Does the program accept a number, and return the square of the number?</li>
                                        <li>Does the program accept a Celsius value and return the Fahrenheit equivalent?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                       <h4 class="h"> White box testing:</h4>
                                       <p> White box testing is a method of testing software focusing on the internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to just its functionality (which black box testing can achieve).
                                        White box testing will focus on the structure of the code and will test every possible path through the code.
                                        In the case of the example program converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, test cases would ensure the individual functions (add, sub, mul and div) work as expected.
                                    </p>
                                        
                                    
                                       <h4 class="h"> Unit testing:</h4>
                                       <p>  A unit should be viewed as the smallest testable part of an application. As each new part of the system is completed, it is tested to make sure it works properly – if not, then other parts of the system that rely on it could fail.
                                        In procedural programming a unit could be a function – for example, the addition function in the code above.
                                        In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), a unit could be an individual method.
                                        Unit tests are completed on short 'snippets' of code. Unit tests are typically written and run by programmers to make sure that code meets its design and behaves as planned.
                            
                                    </p>
                                        
                                       <h4 class="h"> System testing:</h4>
                                       <p> The purpose of a system test is to ensure that all the individually developed units of software work together as intended.
                                        A benefit of system testing is that it helps you discover problems or inconsistencies between the programmed modules, libraries and functions intended to work together.
                                        For example, once all the functionality of the calculator has been completed, it would be tested as an entire system.
