       <h4>1.1 Describing the
            purpose of IT in
            modern business</h4> 
       <p>The use of IT in recent memory has skyrocketed, there are more people using technological entities more than ever. <br>
        In order for business to evolve, it’s a given  that they must include the use of technology into their business.<br> This can be done in numerous ways, such as, building apps and websites to enable online access to their users.<br>
         Moreover, they can integrate technology into how they manage their business, and how it runs as well. One aspect they can apply this is in communication.<br>
          Rapid communications such as email servers, routers, and internal chat servers are examples of communication methods that businesses could use. <br>This helps businesses improve productivity and allow for better decision making.<br>
          Furthermore, streamlined workflow systems, shared storage and collaborative work spaces can increase efficiency in a business and allow employees to process a greater level of work in a shorter period of time. <br>
          Another benefit of IT for businesses is that companies can harness information technology resources to lower their costs.<br>
          Using IT infrastructure, redundant tasks can be centralized at one location. For example, a large company could centralize their payroll function at one location to lower employee costs. <br>
          Lastly, most businesses of the modern era are subject to security threats and vandalism. Technology can be used to protect financial data, confidential executive decisions and other proprietary information that leads to competitive advantages.<br>
           Simply put, technology helps businesses keep their ideas away from their competition. By having computers with passwords, a business can ensure none of its forthcoming projects will be copied by the competition.</p>

           <h4>1.2  Describing methods,
                skills and resources needed
                to complete digital projects
                successfully </h4> 
           <p>One aspect that helps in the successful completion of a digital project is planning, and failing to do so can have unforeseen repercussions.<br>
            Great planning takes a lot of organisation, a forensic attention to detail, and the involvement of all your team.<br>
             You will also have to be flexible, because project priorities change during the course of a project.<br>
              You’ll need to constantly revisit, reshape and refine your plan to make sure you’re adjusting accordingly.<br>
               Furthermore, having a project fail isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it’s important to learn from your mistakes and make the right changes going forward.
                This is why feedback is so important. Encourage everyone involved in the project to express their opinions and concerns openly and honestly. 
                Communication is a crucial aspect in a successful project, the more open you are to communicate with everyone – through emails, phone calls, video chat or in person – the more successful your project will be.
                </p>

             <h4>1.3  Plan and carry out tasks using
                    IT </h4> 
                <p>To plan and carry out tasks using IT, there is  an abundance of software available, one that I used whilst creating this website is Trello. <a  class="trello" href= "https://trello.com/b/WnYlgCpR/website" target="_blank">https://trello.com/b/WnYlgCpR/website</a> .This is the link to my trello board, and shows how I utilised the software to plan and break down the tasks that need to be completed.
                    </p>

              <h4>1.4  Describe the risks that
                    might impact digital projects
                    – what causes digital
                    projects to fail? Why?</h4> 
              <p>One of the risks that might impact the successful completion of a digital project, is that resources may be reallocated for other higher priority projects,<br> this could cause a significant delay, or a complete failure to finish the project.<br> Another common risk to the project is cost risk, and this is mainly due to the poor estimation of costs accurately. <br>Moreover, the risk that activities will take longer than expected. Slippages in schedule, and poor scheduling typically increase costs and also delay the completion of the project, with the project having to be rushed, the expected outcome might be below par of what it was meant to be.
                </p>
             <h4>1.5  Describe how you would go
                    about selecting and using IT
                    systems and software</h4> 
             <p>To select the right software for your project, you would first need to have a general idea of what you want the software to do.<br> Next, it’s best practice to write a list system requirements. This document could include budgetary requirements, technical preferences (i.e) what software you would prefer, as well as usability and functionality requirements.<br> In order to select the right software, you will need to have a clear understanding of who is going to use the software, and look for alternate software, if for any reason the preferred one is not available to the user.<br> Finally, after going through the selection process, the software still needs to be implemented. Project management software is not just for the project manager, it’s for the team.<br> Outline a plan that shows how your team will start using the new software and systems. It might be a good idea to schedule training sessions, if necessary. <br>Also, make sure you have all the necessary tools, that integrations are completed and that all important documents are available in the new solution.
                </p>
            <h4>1.6  Describe and provide
                    analysis on how your chosen
                    technologies have helped
                    you achieve your outcomes.</h4>
            <p>Trello helped me track the progress of my work, showing me a list of things that need to be done, the one’s I am doing, and those that have been completed.<br> This organises my work, and makes the huge task into smaller tasks, making the whole project look simplified. Trello can also be used to work collaboratively with your peers, you can share documents on it, and also link it to other collaborative tools such as slack, which is easily accessed.<br> When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. <br>GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration.
                </p>
             <h4>1.7 Describe legal guidelines
                    and constraints that impact
                    digital projects – How does
                    GDPR impact digital projects? </h4>
             <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU). Since the Regulation applies regardless of where websites are based, it must be heeded by all sites that attract European visitors, even if they don't specifically market goods or services to EU residents.
                    The type of data that the GDPR protects are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic identity information such as name, address and ID numbers</li>
                    <li>Web data such as location, IP address, cookie data and RFID tags</li>
                    <li>Health and genetic data</li>
                    <li>Biometric data</li>
                    <li>Racial or ethnic data</li>
                    <li>Political opinions</li>
                </ul> 
                   <p> If a company does not comply with GDPR, there are serious implications. There will be a penalty for those companies, GDPR  fines up to 4% of annual global revenue, or 20 million euros, whichever is greater. <br>
                    One of the impacts it has is that GDPR has changed a lot of things for companies such as the way your sales teams prospect or the way that marketing activities are managed.<br> Companies have had to review business processes, applications and forms to be compliant with double opt-in rules and email marketing best practices. In order to sign up for communication, prospects will have to fill out a form or tick a box and then confirm it was their actions in a further email.<br>
                    A method to prevent from being fined is to develop and implement safeguards throughout your infrastructure to help contain any data breaches.<br> This means putting security measures in place to guard against data breaches, and taking quick action to notify individuals and authorities in the event a breach does occur.
